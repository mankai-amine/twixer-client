# Twixer – Social Networking Application

# Getting Started/Demo Information

Welcome! If you'd like to see out our application hosted on Heroku, please visit [twixer.xyz](https://twixer-client-7fc12e0d4cd5.herokuapp.com/). This is a full stack web application that was inspired by Twitter/X where users can post and interact with content, and follow other users.  
You can login with the "demouser" credentials for both fields. This account has been set up to follow several users and has an example post to showcase the different feeds and options on the site.
We hope you enjoy our app! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
